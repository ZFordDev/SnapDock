   <strong>SnapDock — Markdown Reader with File‑Tree Navigation</strong><br/>
   Built by <strong>ZFordDev</strong>
</p>

---

## 📄 Overview

SnapDock is a lightweight Markdown reader with a built‑in file‑tree dock, designed for navigating folders of `.md` files quickly and cleanly.  
It’s ideal for documentation, notes, and study workflows where simplicity and speed matter.

## 📦 Release Status

**Current build:** Beta 2.0.1  
This release introduces a redesigned UI, improved Markdown rendering, and a more stable file‑tree dock.

**Next milestone:** RC 2.0.1 (planned January 2026)

## ✨ Why I Made SnapDock

During my studies, I had an exam that required writing in Markdown. Many students were new to Markdown, and most existing tools felt overly complex or cluttered.

SnapDock was created to be a **simple, fast, distraction‑free Markdown reader** with a **file‑tree dock** for navigating folders of `.md` files. It’s perfect for documentation, notes, study materials, and project browsing.

Future plans include expanding support to **PDF viewing**, improving the editor experience, and eventually integrating **AI‑powered writing assistance**.
