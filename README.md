## 📖 Overview

SnapDock is a lightweight Markdown editor built with Electron and powered by **markdown‑it**. It delivers a clean, modern writing experience with a layout inspired by professional IDEs—minus the complexity.

Designed for clarity and stability, SnapDock feels like a traditional writing app, making it the ideal home for your notes, technical docs, and daily thoughts.

---

## 🛡️ Long‑Term Support (LTS)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **SnapDock is an LTS application.** The architecture is intentionally "feature-complete." Future updates focus strictly on security, performance, and bug fixes rather than experimental feature creep.

- **Predictable:** No breaking UI changes.
- **Reliable:** Focused on long-term file safety.
- **Lightweight:** Stays fast as your library grows.
