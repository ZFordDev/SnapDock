# 📦 Project Status

SnapDock 2.x is in **Long‑Term Support (LTS)**.  
The feature set is intentionally complete. Only the following contributions are accepted:

- 🐞 **Bug fixes**
- 🔒 **Security patches**
- 📝 **Documentation improvements**
- ⚙️ **Small, low‑risk quality-of-life fixes**

For new features, UI changes, or larger ideas, please wait for or contribute to **SnapDock 3**, which is the active development line.

# 🛠️ How to Contribute

- **Fork the repository** and create a branch for your changes.  
- Keep commits **focused and minimal** — one logical change per commit.  
- Use imperative commit messages (e.g., `Fix PDF export layout`).  
- Open a **pull request** with a short explanation of what changed and why.

> Note: As SnapDock 2.x is in LTS, PR review times may be slower than usual.

# 🐛 Reporting Issues

Use the **Issues** tab to report:

- Bugs  
- Reproducible crashes  
- Incorrect behavior  
- Security concerns  

Please include:

- Steps to reproduce  
- Expected vs. actual behavior  
- Screenshots or logs if helpful  
- OS + SnapDock version  

If you're unsure whether something is a bug or expected behavior, open an issue anyway — discussion helps.

# 🧪 Testing

Before submitting a PR:

- Run the app locally.
