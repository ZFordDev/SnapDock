## **Troubleshooting**

### **My changes aren’t saving**
SnapDock does **not** auto‑save.  
Each tab must be saved manually using the **Save** button.

Current behaviour:
- If you close a tab with unsaved changes, SnapDock will warn you.  
- A **Save All** option is planned for a future release.  
- Some builds may save files without the `.md` extension — please add `.md` manually until the fix is released.

### **The preview isn’t updating**
This is a known issue when switching tabs while in Preview mode.

Workaround:
1. Switch back to **Editor** mode  
2. Select the tab you want  
3. Press **Preview** again  

A fix is in progress.

### **My files aren’t being saved as markdown files**
Some versions may save files without the `.md` extension.  
This is a known issue — please manually add `.md` when saving.  
A permanent fix is coming soon.

---

### **I closed my workspace and it didn’t prompt me to save changes**
This is a critical known issue affecting workspace closing and reopening.

Current behaviour:
- SnapDock may not warn you about unsaved changes when closing a workspace  
- The workspace may not reopen automatically on next launch  

Until the fix is released:
- Please manually save all tabs before closing the app  
- Persistent workspaces and improved unsaved‑change prompts are being restored soon
