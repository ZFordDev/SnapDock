   <strong>Markdown Workspace with File‑Tree Navigation</strong><br/>
   Built by <strong>ZFordDev</strong>
</p>

---

## Overview

SnapDock is a lightweight Markdown workspace with a built‑in file‑tree dock, designed for navigating and editing folders of `.md` files quickly and cleanly.  
It’s ideal for documentation, notes, and study workflows where simplicity, speed, and clarity matter.

---

## Release Status

**Current build:** Beta 2.1.1  
This update introduces SnapDock’s new **modern Markdown rendering engine** and the first stage of the **PDF export pipeline upgrade**.

### 🔧 What’s new in 2.1.1

- **Modern Markdown renderer (Preview Engine v2)**  
  Supports tables, footnotes, callouts, syntax highlighting, sub/superscript, and more.

- **PDF export pipeline upgraded**  
  PDF rendering now uses a dedicated styling layer, separate from the preview.  
  This unlocks:
  - Page‑break rules  
  - Print‑safe colors  
  - Layout control  
  - Future header/footer support  

- **Architecture cleanup**  
  Rendering logic is now modular, maintainable, and ready for future expansion.

**Next milestone:** UI editor upgrade — improved text box, spacing, and writing experience.

## Why I Made SnapDock

While studying, I noticed how many Markdown tools were overloaded with features, cluttered interfaces, or slow performance — especially for students and developers who just needed to read and navigate `.md` files quickly.

SnapDock was built to be a **simple, fast, distraction‑free Markdown workspace** with a **file‑tree dock** that makes browsing folders of notes effortless.  
It’s ideal for documentation, study materials, and project exploration.

Looking ahead, SnapDock will gain a more capable editor, refined PDF output, and eventually **AI‑assisted writing tools**.
