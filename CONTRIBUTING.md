# Welcome
Thanks for your interest in improving SnapDock!  
This project is built openly, and contributions of all sizes are welcome — from bug fixes and documentation improvements to new ideas that align with SnapDock’s philosophy.

---

# How to Contribute
- **Fork the repo** and create a branch for your changes.  
- Keep commits **focused and clear** — one logical change per commit.  
- Use imperative commit messages (e.g., `Fix PDF export layout`).  
- Open a **pull request** with a short description of what changed and why.

---

# Reporting Issues
- Use the **Issues** tab to report bugs or suggest improvements.  
- Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and logs/screenshots if helpful.  
- If you’re unsure whether something is a bug or a feature request, open an issue anyway — discussion helps.

---

# Coding Guidelines
- Follow the existing style and structure.  
- Keep modules **modular and intentional** — avoid unnecessary complexity.  
- Document new functions or modules clearly.  
- Avoid mixing unrelated fixes/features in one PR.

---

# Testing
- Run the app locally before submitting changes.  
- Ensure your changes don’t break existing functionality.  
- Add tests where practical (especially for Rust modules).

# Community
- Be respectful, constructive, and professional.  
- Collaboration happens via [Discord](https://discord.gg/4RGzagyt7C).  
- See the simplified [Community Guidelines](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Security
If you discover a vulnerability, please follow the [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) policy.  
Do not disclose security issues publicly until reviewed.

# Roadmap Alignment
Before starting large features, check the [README](README.md) roadmap.  
This helps avoid duplicate work and keeps contributions aligned with SnapDock’s long‑term direction.
