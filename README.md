## **Overview**

SnapDock is a lightweight Markdown editor built with Electron and powered by **markdown‑it**.  
It delivers a clean, modern writing experience with a layout inspired by professional editors — but without the bloat.

SnapDock feels closer to a traditional writing app than a developer tool.  
It’s designed for clarity, stability, and long‑term reliability, making it ideal for notes, documents, and everyday writing.

---

## 🛡️ **Long‑Term Support (LTS)**

SnapDock is a **Long‑Term Support** application.

The architecture is intentionally stable and complete.  
Future updates focus exclusively on:

- Bug fixes  
- Safety improvements  
- Performance tuning  
- Minor quality‑of‑life refinements  

SnapDock will **not** undergo major rewrites or experimental feature additions.  
This ensures:

- Predictable behaviour  
- Long‑term reliability  
- Consistent performance  
- A stable writing environment you can trust

# ✅ **Features**

- Modern Markdown rendering (tables, code blocks, callouts, footnotes, etc.)  
- Stable tabbed editing  
- Integrated file‑tree dock  
- **Four themes** with a clean drop‑up selector  
- Recent files with workspace‑aware history  
- Theme‑accurate live preview  
- PDF export  
- Automatic update checker  
- Workspace‑aware behaviour without forced auto‑restore  
- Minimal, distraction‑free interface  

---

# ⚠️ **Known Issues**

1. **PDF export:** Fully functional, but advanced layout tuning is still planned  
2. **macOS builds:** Packaging and testing are in progress; macOS support is not guaranteed yet  
3. **Linux builds:** `.deb` and AppImage are supported, but behaviour may vary across distributions; feedback is encouraged  
4. **Preview mode:** Some advanced Markdown features may render differently between themes  

*(Note: “rapid switching may override unsaved changes” has been removed — it is no longer an issue as of 2.3.0.)*

---

## 🔧 **Maintenance & Stability**

SnapDock is actively maintained with a focus on:

- Stability  
- Bug fixes  
- Performance tuning  
- Platform compatibility  

Major feature expansion is intentionally limited to preserve the LTS identity.

---

## **Recent Changes**

- Fixed workspace close safety  
- Fixed tab‑close freeze caused by blocking dialogs  
- Improved unsaved‑changes detection  
- Preview mode now updates correctly when switching tabs  
- Updated dependency stack  
- Marked SnapDock as **Stable** with a clear LTS roadmap  

---

## **Contribute**

SnapDock is built to grow — and contributions of all kinds are genuinely appreciated.

- **Pull Requests:** Features, fixes, refactors  
- **Issues:** Bugs, suggestions, questions  
- **First‑Time Contributors:** Look for issues tagged **good first issue** or **help wanted** — they’re intentionally designed to be approachable  

If you’re new to open‑source, this is a great place to start. The project is clean, well‑structured, and we’re happy to guide you through your first PR.

# ⭐ **SnapDock V3 (Coming Soon)**

SnapDock V3 is the next major evolution of the editor.  
It focuses on improved performance, a refreshed UI, and a more modern architecture designed for long‑term growth.

V3 is also planned to support:

- **Windows Store distribution**  
- **Snap Store distribution (Linux)**  
- `.deb` and AppImage builds (as today)

macOS support is not currently planned due to the high cost of development on the platform, but may be considered if requested.

### **V2 and V3 Will Remain Separate**

SnapDock V2 will continue to receive Long‑Term Support (LTS) updates.  
V2 **will not automatically upgrade into V3** — both versions will exist side‑by‑side.

- **V2** remains the stable, minimal, long‑term Markdown editor  
- **V3** introduces new UI, improved performance, and modern features  

Users can choose the version that best fits their workflow.
