## SnapDock Community Guidelines  
**We’re building a clean, focused writing environment.  
Let’s keep the community the same way.**

### ✔ Be respectful  
We’re all here to build something useful. Treat others with kindness and patience.

### ✔ Be constructive  
If you open an issue or PR, keep it clear, actionable, and focused on improvement.

### ✔ No harassment or discrimination  
Zero tolerance. Full stop.

### ✔ Keep discussions technical  
SnapDock is a writing tool, not a debate platform.

### ✔ Respect the project’s direction  
SnapDock has a clear identity. Contributions should align with its minimal, distraction‑free philosophy.

### ✔ Issues and PRs may be declined  
Not every idea fits the project. That’s okay — it’s never personal.

### ✔ We value clarity  
Good documentation, clean code, and thoughtful communication are always appreciated.
