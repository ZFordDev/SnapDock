   <strong>Markdown Reader with File‑Tree Navigation</strong><br/>
   Built by <strong>ZFordDev</strong>
</p>

---

## Overview

SnapDock is a lightweight Markdown reader with a built‑in file‑tree dock, designed for navigating folders of `.md` files quickly and cleanly.  
It’s ideal for documentation, notes, and study workflows where simplicity and speed matter.

---

## Release Status

**Current build:** Beta 2.1.0  
This release introduces SnapDock’s new **automatic update system**, powered by Electron’s native updater.  
Once installed, SnapDock can now:

- Check for updates on launch  
- Notify you when a new version is available  
- Download updates in the background  
- Restart to apply updates automatically  

This marks a major step toward a fully self‑maintaining desktop app.

**Next milestone:** Continued Beta improvements — PDF support, performance upgrades, and enhanced file‑handling safety.

## Why I Made SnapDock

While studying, I noticed how many Markdown tools were overloaded with features, cluttered interfaces, or slow performance — especially for students and developers who just needed to read and navigate `.md` files quickly.

SnapDock was built to be a **simple, fast, distraction‑free Markdown reader** with a **file‑tree dock** that makes browsing folders of notes effortless. It’s ideal for documentation, study materials, and project exploration.

Looking ahead, SnapDock will gain **PDF viewing**, a more capable editor, and eventually **AI‑assisted writing tools**.
